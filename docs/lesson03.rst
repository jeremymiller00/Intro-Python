File Input and Output
=====================
So far we have learned how to store information in variables in our program and we have even learned how to prompt the user for information to add to our program. In this lesson we are going to learn how to get data and store data in files on our system. The good news is that python has all the features we need built in to make this process painless. 

Python Builtin

Python gives us serveral `built-in functions`_ helpers to make doing complex things that are very common in programing easier. Open up your interactive prompt. 

>>> dir()
