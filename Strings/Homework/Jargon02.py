Assignment: Create a program that will prompt the user for a string. Take the
string input by the user. Output the sting in side a box that is centered on 
the screen. Use an 80 column screen for this example. Look at the example from
class on how to draw a box. There are many more ways to solve this problem than
the way I presented in the example.

Use the built in len function to determin the lenght of the string.
Also your box is not limited to using the characters I chose for my box. You 
might find it easier to use all * characters for example.
